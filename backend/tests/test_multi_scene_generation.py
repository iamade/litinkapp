SCENE 1: HAGRID'S INTRODUCTION
INT. HAGRID'S COTTAGE - DAY

HAGRID stands by the fireplace, holding a large umbrella.

HAGRID
Yer a wizard, Harry! I've been watching you for years.

HAGRID
Your parents were wizards too, you know. They'd be proud of you.

Harry looks confused but intrigued.

SCENE 2: THE JOURNEY BEGINS
EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY

HAGRID leads Harry through the bustling magical street.

HAGRID
First stop, Gringotts! Got to get you some wizard money.

HAGRID
Don't worry, Harry. I'll be with you every step of the way.

Harry looks around in amazement at the magical shops.

SCENE 3: OLLIVANDER'S WAND SHOP
INT. OLLIVANDER'S - DAY

HAGRID watches as Harry tries different wands.

HAGRID
The wand chooses the wizard, Harry. It's a special moment.

HAGRID
Your father's wand was 11 inches, made of mahogany. Good for transfiguration.

Harry finally finds his wand - holly and phoenix feather.

SCENE 4: PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
EXT. KING'S CROSS STATION - DAY

HAGRID gives Harry final instructions.

HAGRID
Just walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.

HAGRID
Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important.

Harry takes a deep breath and runs toward the barrier.

SCENE 5: THE TRAIN DEPARTS
EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - DAY

HAGRID waves goodbye as the train pulls away.

HAGRID
Have a great year, Harry! Write to me if you need anything!

HAGRID
And remember, you're not alone anymore. You've got friends now.

Harry waves back from the train window, smiling.
