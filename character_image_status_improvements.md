# Character Image Generation Status Improvements

## Problem
The frontend was displaying "successful" immediately after queuing character image generation tasks, even though the actual generation takes 20-30 seconds. This caused confusion as users would see "success" but no image would be displayed yet.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Status Tracking (Already in Place)
The backend Celery task (`generate_character_image_task`) already updates the `characters` table with proper status tracking:
- **pending**: Task queued but not started
- **generating**: Task actively processing 
- **completed**: Image generated and URL available
- **failed**: Generation failed with error

The task flow:
1. Initial state: `pending` (when task is queued)
2. Processing: `generating` (when Celery worker starts)
3. Final: `completed` with `image_url` (after ~30 seconds)

### Frontend Polling Implementation

#### 1. Status Endpoint Integration
Added `getCharacterImageStatus()` method to `userService.ts`:
```typescript
async getCharacterImageStatus(characterId: string): Promise<{
  character_id: string;
  status: string;
  task_id?: string;
  image_url?: string;
  metadata?: any;
  error?: string;
}>
```

#### 2. Polling Logic in PlotOverviewPanel
Enhanced `handleGenerateImage()` to:
- Queue the task via backend API
- Start automatic polling every 1 second
- Track generation progress through status changes
- Auto-reload plot data when `completed` status reached
- Handle errors and timeouts gracefully

```typescript
const pollCharacterImageStatus = async (characterId: string) => {
  // Polls every 1 second for up to 2 minutes
  // Updates UI based on status: pending → generating → completed
  // Shows appropriate toast notifications at each stage
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
Updated `CharacterCard.tsx` to show clearer loading state:
- Animated spinner with magic wand icon
- Status message: "Generating Image"
- Time estimate: "This may take 20-30 seconds..."
- Gradient background for visual appeal

### User Experience Flow

**Before:**
1. User clicks "Generate Image"
2. Toast: "Character image generated successfully" ❌ (misleading)
3. No image appears for 30 seconds
4. User confused about what's happening

**After:**
1. User clicks "Generate Image"
2. Toast: "Image generation queued for 60s" ✅
3. Visual loading indicator with time estimate
4. Progress updates every 10 seconds
5. Toast: "Generating character image..." (during processing)
6. Final toast: "Character image generated successfully" ✅
7. Image appears immediately after completion

### Status Updates Timeline

```
t=0s:    Queue task → Status: "queued" → Toast notification
t=1s:    Start polling
t=2-3s:  Backend picks up task → Status: "generating"
t=10s:   Progress update toast
t=20s:   Progress update toast  
t=30s:   Status: "completed", image_url available → Success toast
         Reload plot data → Image displays
```

### Error Handling

- **Failed Generation**: Shows error message from backend
- **Timeout**: After 2 minutes of polling, shows timeout message
- **Network Errors**: Gracefully handles API failures
- **Cleanup**: Always removes loading state on completion/error

### Benefits

1. **Accurate Status**: Users see real-time generation progress
2. **Clear Expectations**: Time estimates set proper expectations
3. **Better UX**: No premature success messages
4. **Resilient**: Handles errors and edge cases
5. **Informative**: Shows actual backend processing status

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Plot/PlotOverviewPanel.tsx**
   - Enhanced `handleGenerateImage()` with polling
   - Added `pollCharacterImageStatus()` function

2. **src/services/userService.ts**
   - Added `getCharacterImageStatus()` method

3. **src/components/Plot/CharacterCard.tsx**
   - Improved loading state visual design
   - Added time estimate and better messaging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate a character image and observe status updates
2. Verify toast notifications appear at correct times
3. Check that loading state clears properly on completion
4. Test error scenarios (network failure, backend error)
5. Test timeout handling (mock slow backend response)
6. Generate multiple images simultaneously to verify isolation

## Backend Logs Reference

The Celery logs show the complete generation flow:
```
[CharacterImageTask] Starting generation for Dursley
[CharacterImageTask] Updated character status to 'generating'
[MODELSLAB V7 IMAGE] Generating image with model: imagen-4.0-ultra
[CharacterImageTask] Updated character with image URL
[CharacterImageTask] Successfully generated character image
```

The frontend now accurately reflects these backend state transitions.
