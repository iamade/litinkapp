SCENE 1 - DURSLEY HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Wide shot of the Dursley household. Camera zooms in on Vernon Dursley (selecting his tie). 
Petunia Dursley (muttering to herself) says: "That Lily Potter... she's so different." 
Camera pans to show their neat and tidy home. Vernon (looking concerned) adjusts his mustache. 
Close-up on Petunia (gossiping while tending to Dudley).

VERNON
I don't want any of that... that magic nonsense in this house!

PETUNIA
(scoffs)
As if we'd allow it. We're perfectly normal, thank you very much.

Camera follows Vernon as he walks to the window. He looks out at the street.

VERNON
(whispering)
They're out there, you know. Watching us.

FADE OUT
